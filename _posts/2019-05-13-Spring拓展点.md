# Spring 拓展点

## BeanPostProcessor

```java
/**
 * Factory hook that allows for custom modification of new bean instances,
 * e.g. checking for marker interfaces or wrapping them with proxies.
 *
 * <p>ApplicationContexts can autodetect BeanPostProcessor beans in their
 * bean definitions and apply them to any beans subsequently created.
 * Plain bean factories allow for programmatic registration of post-processors,
 * applying to all beans created through this factory.
 *
 * <p>Typically, post-processors that populate beans via marker interfaces
 * or the like will implement {@link #postProcessBeforeInitialization},
 * while post-processors that wrap beans with proxies will normally
 * implement {@link #postProcessAfterInitialization}.
 *
 * @author Juergen Hoeller
 * @since 10.10.2003
 * @see InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor
 * @see DestructionAwareBeanPostProcessor
 * @see ConfigurableBeanFactory#addBeanPostProcessor
 * @see BeanFactoryPostProcessor
 */
public interface BeanPostProcessor {

	/**
	 * Apply this BeanPostProcessor to the given new bean instance <i>before</i> any bean
	 * initialization callbacks (like InitializingBean's {@code afterPropertiesSet}
	 * or a custom init-method). The bean will already be populated with property values.
	 * The returned bean instance may be a wrapper around the original.
	 * <p>The default implementation returns the given {@code bean} as-is.
	 * @param bean the new bean instance
	 * @param beanName the name of the bean
	 * @return the bean instance to use, either the original or a wrapped one;
	 * if {@code null}, no subsequent BeanPostProcessors will be invoked
	 * @throws org.springframework.beans.BeansException in case of errors
	 * @see org.springframework.beans.factory.InitializingBean#afterPropertiesSet
	 */
	@Nullable
	default Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException {
		return bean;
	}

	/**
	 * Apply this BeanPostProcessor to the given new bean instance <i>after</i> any bean
	 * initialization callbacks (like InitializingBean's {@code afterPropertiesSet}
	 * or a custom init-method). The bean will already be populated with property values.
	 * The returned bean instance may be a wrapper around the original.
	 * <p>In case of a FactoryBean, this callback will be invoked for both the FactoryBean
	 * instance and the objects created by the FactoryBean (as of Spring 2.0). The
	 * post-processor can decide whether to apply to either the FactoryBean or created
	 * objects or both through corresponding {@code bean instanceof FactoryBean} checks.
	 * <p>This callback will also be invoked after a short-circuiting triggered by a
	 * {@link InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor#postProcessBeforeInstantiation} method,
	 * in contrast to all other BeanPostProcessor callbacks.
	 * <p>The default implementation returns the given {@code bean} as-is.
	 * @param bean the new bean instance
	 * @param beanName the name of the bean
	 * @return the bean instance to use, either the original or a wrapped one;
	 * if {@code null}, no subsequent BeanPostProcessors will be invoked
	 * @throws org.springframework.beans.BeansException in case of errors
	 * @see org.springframework.beans.factory.InitializingBean#afterPropertiesSet
	 * @see org.springframework.beans.factory.FactoryBean
	 */
	@Nullable
	default Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException {
		return bean;
	}

}
```

其中`postProcessBeforeInitialization`在`bean`初始化前提供回调，`postProcessAfterInitialization`在`bean`初始化后提供回调。

可以通过`postProcessBeforeInitialization`自定义返回的`bean`实例；可以通过`postProcessAfterInitialization`在`bean`实例化后修改原有的`bean`，如对其包装、代理等。

## InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor

```java
/**
 * Subinterface of {@link BeanPostProcessor} that adds a before-instantiation callback,
 * and a callback after instantiation but before explicit properties are set or
 * autowiring occurs.
 *
 * <p>Typically used to suppress default instantiation for specific target beans,
 * for example to create proxies with special TargetSources (pooling targets,
 * lazily initializing targets, etc), or to implement additional injection strategies
 * such as field injection.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> This interface is a special purpose interface, mainly for
 * internal use within the framework. It is recommended to implement the plain
 * {@link BeanPostProcessor} interface as far as possible, or to derive from
 * {@link InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessorAdapter} in order to be shielded
 * from extensions to this interface.
 *
 * @author Juergen Hoeller
 * @author Rod Johnson
 * @since 1.2
 * @see org.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.AbstractAutoProxyCreator#setCustomTargetSourceCreators
 * @see org.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.target.LazyInitTargetSourceCreator
 */
public interface InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor extends BeanPostProcessor {

   /**
    * Apply this BeanPostProcessor <i>before the target bean gets instantiated</i>.
    * The returned bean object may be a proxy to use instead of the target bean,
    * effectively suppressing default instantiation of the target bean.
    * <p>If a non-null object is returned by this method, the bean creation process
    * will be short-circuited. The only further processing applied is the
    * {@link #postProcessAfterInitialization} callback from the configured
    * {@link BeanPostProcessor BeanPostProcessors}.
    * <p>This callback will only be applied to bean definitions with a bean class.
    * In particular, it will not be applied to beans with a factory method.
    * <p>Post-processors may implement the extended
    * {@link SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor} interface in order
    * to predict the type of the bean object that they are going to return here.
    * <p>The default implementation returns {@code null}.

    * instances being invoked on this bean instance.
    * @throws org.springframework.beans.BeansException in case of errors
    * @see #postProcessBeforeInstantiation
    */
   default boolean postProcessAfterInstantiation(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException {
      return true;
   }

   /**
    * Post-process the given property values before the factory applies them
    * to the given bean, without any need for property descriptors.
    * <p>Implementations should return {@code null} (the default) if they provide a custom

   default PropertyValues postProcessPropertyValues(
         PropertyValues pvs, PropertyDescriptor[] pds, Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException {

      return pvs;
   }

}
```

继承了`BeanPostProcessor`，在此基础上添加了实例化前、实例化后和处理`Bean`属性之前的拓展。通常用作创建代理。

拓展点的执行顺序为：先实例化，在初始化

```sequence
postProcessBeforeInstantiation->postProcessAfterInstantiation:
#postProcessAfterInstantiation->postProcessProperties:
postProcessProperties->postProcessBeforeInitialization:
postProcessBeforeInitialization->postProcessAfterInitialization:

```

## BeanNameAware

```java
/**
 * Interface to be implemented by beans that want to be aware of their
 * bean name in a bean factory. Note that it is not usually recommended
 * that an object depends on its bean name, as this represents a potentially
 * brittle dependence on external configuration, as well as a possibly
 * unnecessary dependence on a Spring API.
 *
 * <p>For a list of all bean lifecycle methods, see the
 * {@link BeanFactory BeanFactory javadocs}.
 *
 * @author Juergen Hoeller
 * @author Chris Beams
 * @since 01.11.2003
 * @see BeanClassLoaderAware
 * @see BeanFactoryAware
 * @see InitializingBean
 */
public interface BeanNameAware extends Aware {

	/**
	 * Set the name of the bean in the bean factory that created this bean.
	 * <p>Invoked after population of normal bean properties but before an
	 * init callback such as {@link InitializingBean#afterPropertiesSet()}
	 * or a custom init-method.
	 * @param name the name of the bean in the factory.
	 * Note that this name is the actual bean name used in the factory, which may
	 * differ from the originally specified name: in particular for inner bean
	 * names, the actual bean name might have been made unique through appending
	 * "#..." suffixes. Use the {@link BeanFactoryUtils#originalBeanName(String)}
	 * method to extract the original bean name (without suffix), if desired.
	 */
	void setBeanName(String name);

}
```

可以设置`BeanName`，从而通过`getBean`获得该`BeanName`的`Bean`。

## ApplicationContextAware 

```java
/**
 * Interface to be implemented by any object that wishes to be notified
 * of the {@link ApplicationContext} that it runs in.
 *
 * <p>Implementing this interface makes sense for example when an object
 * requires access to a set of collaborating beans. Note that configuration
 * via bean references is preferable to implementing this interface just
 * for bean lookup purposes.
 *
 * <p>This interface can also be implemented if an object needs access to file
 * resources, i.e. wants to call {@code getResource}, wants to publish
 * an application event, or requires access to the MessageSource. However,
 * it is preferable to implement the more specific {@link ResourceLoaderAware},
 * {@link ApplicationEventPublisherAware} or {@link MessageSourceAware} interface
 * in such a specific scenario.
 *
 * <p>Note that file resource dependencies can also be exposed as bean properties
 * of type {@link org.springframework.core.io.Resource}, populated via Strings
 * with automatic type conversion by the bean factory. This removes the need
 * for implementing any callback interface just for the purpose of accessing
 * a specific file resource.
 *
 * <p>{@link org.springframework.context.support.ApplicationObjectSupport} is a
 * convenience base class for application objects, implementing this interface.
 *
 * <p>For a list of all bean lifecycle methods, see the
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory BeanFactory javadocs}.
 *
 * @author Rod Johnson
 * @author Juergen Hoeller
 * @author Chris Beams
 * @see ResourceLoaderAware
 * @see ApplicationEventPublisherAware
 * @see MessageSourceAware
 * @see org.springframework.context.support.ApplicationObjectSupport
 * @see org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactoryAware
 */
public interface ApplicationContextAware extends Aware {

	/**
	 * Set the ApplicationContext that this object runs in.
	 * Normally this call will be used to initialize the object.
	 * <p>Invoked after population of normal bean properties but before an init callback such
	 * as {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.InitializingBean#afterPropertiesSet()}
	 * or a custom init-method. Invoked after {@link ResourceLoaderAware#setResourceLoader},
	 * {@link ApplicationEventPublisherAware#setApplicationEventPublisher} and
	 * {@link MessageSourceAware}, if applicable.
	 * @param applicationContext the ApplicationContext object to be used by this object
	 * @throws ApplicationContextException in case of context initialization errors
	 * @throws BeansException if thrown by application context methods
	 * @see org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanInitializationException
	 */
	void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException;

}
```



## BeanFactoryAware



## BeanFactoryPostProcessor

```java
/**
 * Allows for custom modification of an application context's bean definitions,
 * adapting the bean property values of the context's underlying bean factory.
 *
 * <p>Application contexts can auto-detect BeanFactoryPostProcessor beans in
 * their bean definitions and apply them before any other beans get created.
 *
 * <p>Useful for custom config files targeted at system administrators that
 * override bean properties configured in the application context.
 *
 * <p>See PropertyResourceConfigurer and its concrete implementations
 * for out-of-the-box solutions that address such configuration needs.
 *
 * <p>A BeanFactoryPostProcessor may interact with and modify bean
 * definitions, but never bean instances. Doing so may cause premature bean
 * instantiation, violating the container and causing unintended side-effects.
 * If bean instance interaction is required, consider implementing
 * {@link BeanPostProcessor} instead.
 *
 * @author Juergen Hoeller
 * @since 06.07.2003
 * @see BeanPostProcessor
 * @see PropertyResourceConfigurer
 */
@FunctionalInterface
public interface BeanFactoryPostProcessor {

	/**
	 * Modify the application context's internal bean factory after its standard
	 * initialization. All bean definitions will have been loaded, but no beans
	 * will have been instantiated yet. This allows for overriding or adding
	 * properties even to eager-initializing beans.
	 * @param beanFactory the bean factory used by the application context
	 * @throws org.springframework.beans.BeansException in case of errors
	 */
	void postProcessBeanFactory(ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory) throws BeansException;

}
```

在`BeanDefinition`创建时候，`Bean`初始化之前，可以通过此拓展点读取`BeanDefinition`的配置信息。如其实现类`PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer`，可以读取外部`.properties`文件来设置`BeanDefinition`。

## BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor

```java
/**
 * Extension to the standard {@link BeanFactoryPostProcessor} SPI, allowing for
 * the registration of further bean definitions <i>before</i> regular
 * BeanFactoryPostProcessor detection kicks in. In particular,
 * BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor may register further bean definitions
 * which in turn define BeanFactoryPostProcessor instances.
 *
 * @author Juergen Hoeller
 * @since 3.0.1
 * @see org.springframework.context.annotation.ConfigurationClassPostProcessor
 */
public interface BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor extends BeanFactoryPostProcessor {

   /**
    * Modify the application context's internal bean definition registry after its
    * standard initialization. All regular bean definitions will have been loaded,
    * but no beans will have been instantiated yet. This allows for adding further
    * bean definitions before the next post-processing phase kicks in.
    * @param registry the bean definition registry used by the application context
    * @throws org.springframework.beans.BeansException in case of errors
    */
   void postProcessBeanDefinitionRegistry(BeanDefinitionRegistry registry) throws BeansException;

}
```

`BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor`继承了`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`

## FactoryBean

```java
/**
 * Interface to be implemented by objects used within a {@link BeanFactory} which
 * are themselves factories for individual objects. If a bean implements this
 * interface, it is used as a factory for an object to expose, not directly as a
 * bean instance that will be exposed itself.
 *
 * <p><b>NB: A bean that implements this interface cannot be used as a normal bean.</b>
 * A FactoryBean is defined in a bean style, but the object exposed for bean
 * references ({@link #getObject()}) is always the object that it creates.
 *
 * <p>FactoryBeans can support singletons and prototypes, and can either create
 * objects lazily on demand or eagerly on startup. The {@link SmartFactoryBean}
 * interface allows for exposing more fine-grained behavioral metadata.
 *
 * <p>This interface is heavily used within the framework itself, for example for
 * the AOP {@link org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean} or the
 * {@link org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean}. It can be used for
 * custom components as well; however, this is only common for infrastructure code.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code FactoryBean} is a programmatic contract. Implementations are not
 * supposed to rely on annotation-driven injection or other reflective facilities.</b>
 * {@link #getObjectType()} {@link #getObject()} invocations may arrive early in
 * the bootstrap process, even ahead of any post-processor setup. If you need access
 * other beans, implement {@link BeanFactoryAware} and obtain them programmatically.
 *
 * <p>Finally, FactoryBean objects participate in the containing BeanFactory's
 * synchronization of bean creation. There is usually no need for internal
 * synchronization other than for purposes of lazy initialization within the
 * FactoryBean itself (or the like).
 *
 * @author Rod Johnson
 * @author Juergen Hoeller
 * @since 08.03.2003
 * @param <T> the bean type
 * @see org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory
 * @see org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean
 * @see org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean
 */
public interface FactoryBean<T> {

	/**
	 * Return an instance (possibly shared or independent) of the object
	 * managed by this factory.
	 * <p>As with a {@link BeanFactory}, this allows support for both the
	 * Singleton and Prototype design pattern.
	 * <p>If this FactoryBean is not fully initialized yet at the time of
	 * the call (for example because it is involved in a circular reference),
	 * throw a corresponding {@link FactoryBeanNotInitializedException}.
	 * <p>As of Spring 2.0, FactoryBeans are allowed to return {@code null}
	 * objects. The factory will consider this as normal value to be used; it
	 * will not throw a FactoryBeanNotInitializedException in this case anymore.
	 * FactoryBean implementations are encouraged to throw

	 * this method should try to avoid singleton creation as far as possible;
	 * it should rather estimate the type in advance.
	 * For prototypes, returning a meaningful type here is advisable too.
	 * <p>This method can be called <i>before</i> this FactoryBean has
	 * been fully initialized. It must not rely on state created during
	 * initialization; of course, it can still use such state if available.

	 * {@code null} here. Therefore it is highly recommended to implement
	 * this method properly, using the current state of the FactoryBean.

`FactoryBean`为工厂`Bean`，通过`getObject`才会返回实际的`Bean`。可以通过它

来构建、自定义`Bean`。如`Bean`初始化逻辑十分复杂，可以使用`FactoryBean`来初始化你的`Bean`。Mybatis的`SqlSessionFactoryBean`就是使用了此拓展点。
